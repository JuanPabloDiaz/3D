  <h3 align="center">A 3D Developer Portfolio</h3>
</div>

This project is a fork of the original [3D Portfolio project](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio). The idea is to learn and improve my skills in **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**

It offers a visually stunning platform to showcase your skills and projects, featuring smooth animations and responsive design.

To fully interact with the 3D elements of this project, please use a desktop browser.
